# VRP Integration Guide

This document describes how to connect external systems to VRP Core using the SDK.

## Overview

The VRP SDK enables structured interaction with the protocol’s behavioral engine.  
It supports session lifecycle management, movement triggers, and event handling.

## Modules

- **Authentication** — token-based access to VRP Core  
- **Session Lifecycle** — start, pause, mutate, terminate  
- **Movement Triggers** — behavioral routing based on entropy and motion  
- **Event Stream** — WebSocket-based updates from VRP Core  

## Status

Documentation is being finalized for structured release.  
Integration examples will be added as the protocol stabilizes.
