# Basic Session Example

This example demonstrates a minimal VRP session lifecycle using the SDK.

## Flow (planned)

1. Authenticate with VRP Core
2. Start a session
3. Send a movement event
4. Receive a response from the behavioral engine
5. Terminate the session

This example will be added once the integration layer stabilizes.
