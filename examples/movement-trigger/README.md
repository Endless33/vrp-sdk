# Movement Trigger Example

This example will show how to send movement-based entropy signals to VRP Core.

## Flow (planned)

1. Initialize SDK client
2. Generate a movement trigger
3. Send trigger to VRP Core
4. Observe routing mutation in the event stream

Source code will be added during structured release.
